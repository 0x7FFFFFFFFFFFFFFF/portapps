## About

ðŸš€ **Portapps** is a collection of portable apps for Windows. Each portable app has a single EXE `[appname]-portable.exe` written in [Golang](https://golang.org/) to make it portable.<br />

In short, it's a wrapper that includes system records within the same directory to make the application portable. This will allow you, for example, to use your favorite application on a USB stick.
